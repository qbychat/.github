## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome!

## Why create QMessenger

The chat software on the market is basically capital-driven.

We need an open source, secure chat software, so QMessenger was born

## Feature

1. Encrypted database
2. No short videos
3. No ads
4. 

## Disclaimer

QMessenger is not safer than some software. We created it to get a clean chat software, not to engage in illegal activities. If the project is used for illegal activities, I will delete all the repositories.

There is nothing wrong with technology, it is the people who use it in the wrong way that are wrong
